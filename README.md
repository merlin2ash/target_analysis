# Target_analysis
The main objective of the Target SQL business case is to analyze the given dataset from Target Store, derive insights, and present recommendations to improve business outcomes. The analysis aims to provide valuable information for decision-making and strategic planning within the context of Target's operations in Brazil.

Here is a summary of the key findings and analyses conducted: 

Insights

The following insights can be derived from the given dataset.  

Cities, States, Customers & Sellers:
1.	Top states with more Customers - San Paulo, Rio de janeiro
2.	Top states with more Sellers - San Paulo, Curitiba and Rio continue 
3.	All the registered sellers at Target are active and they have sales
4.	Cities and States with more number of Sellers have recorded high number of Orders 
5.	There is no correlation b/w the product price and high freight value
   
Orders:
1.	August is the top order month. 
2.	August, May and July have more number of Orders. 
3.	September has the lowest number of Orders
4.	Surprisingly the number of orders relatively seem to be less on week-ends compared to week-days, and Monday being the top order day.
5.	There doesn’t seem to be any pattern in terms of which date of a month more orders are placed, like salary week or mid week or           anything like that.

Freight Value:
1.	High freight value have less number of orders
2.	Lower freight value have higher number of orders
3.	There are 9 orders with zero freight charges, and their total order count is 383
4.	30% of orders have freight value $20 and above
5.	80% of orders are from products who have freight value between 10 and 20
6.	13% of orders are from products who have freight value less than 10

Payment Options:
1.	Preferred payment option is Credit Card with 78%
2.	UPI mode of payment is 17%
3.	Voucher holds 2% of overall payment value

Instalments: 
1.	Maximum instalment duration is Two years
2.	Customers seem to prefer/paid lower instalment than dragging it too long. 80% of the instalments are within first 4 months

Delivery:
1.	Delivery status indicates 97% of the orders are delivered & completed
2.	Only 0.6% of total orders either cancelled or unavailable which is a good sign 
3.	It’s heartening to see the ‘Order to delivery’ is 30 weeks and there around good number of orders with more than 20 weeks delivery       duration, which is not good.

Reviews:
1.	57% of the total orders have got top review score
2.	11% of the orders have got low review score

Products:
1.	The top 3 product categories with more number of orders are ‘bed table bath’, ‘health beauty’ and ‘sports’.
2.	‘Insurance and Services’ and ‘Children’s Fashion Clothing’  are the product categories with less number of orders.
3.	Though ‘Toys’ has only one product, the number of product images are high. Similarly we can see babies and pet products have more        photos.
4.	All the products have atleast one product image.

Recommendations

Based on the given dataset and above analysis, some of the recommendations are: 

1.	States like Acre (AC), Amazonas (AM), Bahia (BA) are with less number of Customers. Incidentally Sellers count also low in those         states, and there by Sales are low in these states. Target can increase the number of Sellers to attract more customers and more         orders.
2.	In such above States & Cities, Target can come up with seasonal promotions and increase Customer count.
3.	The location/region where UPI payment is not used, probably because UPI payment type is not available OR people are not still            comfortable to use that option in that location/region. Target can check and provide the option appropriately. 
4.	The location where voucher payment type is not/less used, probably Target can give voucher promotions in that region. 
5.	If a particular state/city is not/less using the instalment type means, probably the given duration of 2 years may not be suffice.       Target can try to increase the instalment duration in those regions and see if it attracts more customers. 
6.	Customers who make frequent purchases – recognize them with rewards, privileges.
7.	Target can come up with promotions for the months like September where Sales is low.
8.	Freight charges are really high for few orders which certainly need to be looked at and can be reduced.
9.	Order to delivery duration is seemingly high for few orders which certainly have to be sorted out.
10.	‘Insurance and Services’, ‘Children’s Fashion Clothing’, ‘PC Gamer’ are the product categories with less sales, which is an area of       opportunity to improve
11.	There are 11% or Orders with low review scores. Target must review these scores and improve based on the given user comments.
